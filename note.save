Storing & representing Image data w/ code
*all our images will be generated by using draw_line to connect pairs of points.
*we need to keep track of the defining points of  an image.
*we can store image data as a list* of points
[p0,p1,p2,p3....pn]

4 x N matrix

Matrix Multiplication
A x B != B x A
# OF cols in A = # of rows in B
[a][b][c] x [1] = [1a + 2b + 3c] 
 1 x 3      [2]     1    x   1
            [3]    row A    col B
            3 x 1

[a][b][c] x [1 4] = [1a + 2b + 3c][4a + 5b + 6c]
            [2 5]             1 x 2
            [3 6]        

[a][b][c]   [1][4]   [1a + 2b + 3c][4a + 5b + 6c]
[d][e][f] x [2][5] = [1d + 2e + 3f][4d + 5e + 6f]
[g][h][i]   [3][6]   [1g + 2h + 3i][4g + 5h + 6i]

multiplicative identity
I x A = A
